# 🚗 Classic Car Racing Game (Built with Amazon Q CLI)

Remember those pixelated, top-down car racing games on your old feature phone?  
The thrill of dodging traffic and hitting perfect turns sparked a passion for speed and strategy that few modern games can replicate.

I became completely captivated by those early racing experiences!

Now, I’ve recreated that classic feel using **Python**, **Pygame**, and a modern twist—  
I built this entire game using **Amazon Q CLI** in **just one prompt**. Yes, really!
